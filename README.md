## Automated Detection of Gender Discriminatory Remarks Online: Based on BERT and Logistic Regression Models

Sexism is still a serious problem in contemporary society, and it exists in various forms in online forums, social media platforms, and everyday communication. With the advent of the digital age, cyberspace has become a prime place for people to express their views, share experiences and exchange ideas, but unfortunately, it has also become a new avenue for sexist speech to spread. It is therefore critical to effectively identify and respond to online sexism.

By utilizing advanced NLP technology, we can automatically detect and analyze sexist speech patterns, thereby helping to reduce sexism in cyberspace. This code applies BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and logistic regression model to detect and analyze sexist speech in online content. The performance of the two models is also compared.
